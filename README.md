# Contao OnePage Content Bundle

This bundle create an One Page Navigation Element.

## Why

Instead of outputting the entire navigation, we only wanted to output the direct sub-items of the current page. 

Hiding of the elements that are not required via CSS is no longer necessary. 

## How

Create a new module of type "Dynamic Subnavigation" (Category = Navigation).

Embed the module in the layout theme.
